<p>Believe it or not - I used to be full of optimism. I grew up in <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps?q=,&#43;Plymouth,&#43;,&#43;uk">Plymouth, UK</a> (the original one) - and it&rsquo;s a very slow town. There isn’t a huge amount going on down there - the counties of Devon and Cornwall are, in England, often the places people go to retire. The average salary is £39.8k ($51.5k USD) - which was much less in around 2010 when I was sitting in my mom&rsquo;s garden debating what I wanted to do with my life at age 20. I had a pretty misspent youth, but I loved computers - and I loved videogames. I&rsquo;d even worked at one of the only web design agencies in the southwest of England - as an apprentice - for a huge £2/hour (£80/week).</p>
<p>I wanted to make videogames - that was my end goal at the time. I liked playing them, I liked computers and had dabbled a little bit with programming and web design. Naturally, the most logical thing was to get a Computer Science degree - so I did. In my final year, I built a video game analytics platform for Epic Games&rsquo; latest videogame <em>Paragon</em> (this was before Fortnite). I&rsquo;d reverse-engineered the game client, scraped all of the matches, and put them all on a website where you could see how you did and where you might need to improve. I started the /r/Paragon subreddit and ran the largest Discord server. Epic even flew me to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iZw1_ltHjI">North Caroliona</a> (Epic HQ) and Berlin for Paragon events. 35-year-old me would have called this &lsquo;cringe&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In 2016 - my website caught the eye of Wikia (later rebranded as <a href="https://fandom.com">Fandom</a>), as they were looking to expand outside of their core wiki platform - and a small while later I was acqui-hired. My career trajectory had taken off just after graduation, and a couple years later I had the opportunity to work in the US on an L1-B visa for a six-figure salary. Very cool!</p>
<p>The preamble is important to understand how I got here. I was a very positive person who had a lot of luck. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to build new things. Since 2016 (9 years ago) I&rsquo;ve probably built over 50 &ldquo;new products&rdquo; - at least to 90%. They always say that the last 10% takes 90% of the time, and that has definitely been true for me. When I hit that wall I would lose my interest, and eventually find something else to build. I would learn a ton, and I&rsquo;ve done this so many times I can spin up an almost-complete full stack app in record time - but I would never finish.</p>
<p>I recently quit a job I wasn&rsquo;t enjoying, and I&rsquo;ve been trying to be a little bit more introspective about my actions - to try to regain some of my optimism. I think a lot about the projects I&rsquo;ve started and stopped, and why I never put them out there. The biggest reason, I think, is that I don’t want to be <em>cringe</em>. I didn&rsquo;t want to be the guy pushing my latest thing, trying to convince people it&rsquo;s the next best thing. I&rsquo;m fairly online, so I see this daily. Everyone is pushing something. On X, Instagram, TikTok - people crave attention - and people do a lot of really embarrassing things to get it. I see people dancing in public. I see people filming themselves at the gym. I see the crypto bros, the AI entrepreneurs, the course sellers, the digital nomads, the fitness influencers, the LinkedIn &rsquo;thought leaders&rsquo; - all pushing their agenda and products. Internally, I’ve labeled these people <em>cringe</em>, without much further thought. But really, they’re grinding. They’re trying to grow their reach in an environment that is public, chaotic, and open to criticism — by lurkers like me who label them <em>cringe</em> and move on.</p>
<p>In 9 years though, I haven&rsquo;t launched anything - <em>they have</em>. I haven&rsquo;t put anything out there, because I don&rsquo;t want to be embarrassing. What if I launch something and nobody uses it? That would be <em>cringe</em>. What if I think something is really cool - and later it isn&rsquo;t? That would be <em>cringe</em>. It&rsquo;s like when I look at code I wrote a few years ago - it&rsquo;s embarrassing - what was I thinking! But I haven&rsquo;t launched anything in 9 years (outside of my day job), and I wish I had. To me, at least - that&rsquo;s the most <em>cringe</em> thing I can think of. Not doing things because you fear you&rsquo;re not good enough. Or that no one will care. Or that you&rsquo;ll embarrass yourself. That&rsquo;s a really sad thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a particularly gifted writer, but this is my first step. The second will be launching something - even if it&rsquo;s not perfect. Because not doing anything? That&rsquo;s worse than being a little <em>cringe</em>.</p>
