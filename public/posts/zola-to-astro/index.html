<p>Every year at some point I like to give my website a little revamp. It&rsquo;s usually around January when I&rsquo;m full of motivation and creativity - and I tell myself I&rsquo;ll actually commit to writing more often. Writing really helps me solidify my thoughts and learning, so it&rsquo;s usually a well-intentioned spur of motiviation. Inevitably - as the year goes on and as work and family life gets in the way, this goal often gets side-tracked.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t promise to myself that this year is going to be any different, but I thought I&rsquo;d at least try to approach it in a different way. I found a website by Brad Woods of his &ldquo;<a href="https://garden.bradwoods.io">digital garden</a>&rdquo;, and while I definitely don&rsquo;t have the patience or organization to care for my website like a bonsai tree - it gave me some ideas for an alternative approach.</p>
<p>I often don&rsquo;t want to write because I worry that it might make me look a little incompetent if I get things wrong or &ldquo;not quite right&rdquo;. People in the tech crowd especially have a tendancy to always point out when you&rsquo;re wrong, which is mostly a helpful thing - though it can make you feel really stupid at times.</p>
<p>My theory is that if I write for just myself, and for my learning - rather than to explain to others, I&rsquo;ll have a better time. After all, nobody reads this anyway! As such, I plan on writing substantially more, about topics I know really well - and topics I don&rsquo;t - as a way to help solidify learning. There are some topics I thought I knew really well last year, but when asked to explain them I found it really difficult. This is something I&rsquo;d like to improve in 2023.</p>
<h2 id="as-for-astro">As for Astro<a href="#as-for-astro" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>As for the website, I went for a retro-style design that I designed &amp; built in a couple evenings using <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>. You can change colors, and if you really hate the CRT effect - disable that too (go HD!). I also wanted to make navigation a little more interesting, so there&rsquo;s an almost CLI-like tool at the top of the page you can use (hotkey: /).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using Astro on a couple side projects and found it pretty fun, and I wanted to put a little bit of personality into my site this year - rather than the minimalist designs of years past. Getting up to speed with Astro is pretty quick, and I can mostly write in Markdown (or .mdx) - allowing me to slot in interactivity with (for example) React components. This could be a fun way to express ideas in more than just words.</p>
<p>Finally, as always, my personal site is hosted with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.</p>
