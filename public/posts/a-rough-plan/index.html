        <p>To get started, I want to first outline my goals for the foreseeable future. In my first post, I mentioned that I have limited time to spend on my game dev ambitions so it&rsquo;s important that the hours I do spend are productive. I watched a <a href="https://youtu.be/g5f7yixtQPc">GDC talk by David Wehle</a> (<a href="https://www.thefirsttree.com/">The First Tree</a>) who mentioned he spent roughly 10 hours a week on his game, due to work commitments and real-life - and that he never had a 0% day. Every day should have <em>some</em> progress, no matter how small. These are tenets I&rsquo;d like to follow.</p>
<h3 id="checking-out-unreal">Checking out Unreal<a href="#checking-out-unreal" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>I spent the past year learning Unity - so a question I openly ask myself is why should I learn Unreal Engine? I haven&rsquo;t released anything in Unity, but I feel I have a strong grasp on the fundamentals - and C# is a very pleasant language to work with. Their headquarters are also just a few blocks from Fandom in San Francisco. I do however have some gripes.</p>
<p>At the moment Unity feels like it&rsquo;s in-between phases. There is a LARGE amount of really cool stuff coming from Unity - &ldquo;soon&rdquo;. The <a href="https://unity.com/dots">Data Oriented Technology Stack</a> (DOTS), a revamped <a href="https://unity.com/solutions/multiplayer-services">networking and multiplayer system</a>, a new <a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/04/23/whats-new-with-uielements-in-2019-1/">UI system</a> replacing years of not-good-enough solutions - and <a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/">much more</a>. The problem is - these are all not-quite-there yet. They represent large changes in how to make games in Unity, and when you want to learn how to do something, you&rsquo;ll get 2 answers - how to do it now, and how to do it &ldquo;soon&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Obviously, investing time in learning something that will soon be deprecated isn&rsquo;t great, but the replacements are also in a constant state of change. This feeling of limbo is strongly felt in the Unity community at the moment, and I think for new developers it&rsquo;s a particularly difficult time to get started.</p>
<p>Unreal on the other hand has made statements that Unreal 4 projects will be forwards-compatible with it&rsquo;s 5th edition. That&rsquo;s exciting. They aren&rsquo;t however particularly indie-friendly, and learning resources are considerably slimmer by comparison.</p>

<h3 id="my-game-goals">My game goals<a href="#my-game-goals" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to be experimenting in both game engines until I land on a prototype I think is worth pursuing. I&rsquo;m not married to either game engine yet, but I think it&rsquo;s important to explore all of the options available.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also not entirely sure what type of game I&rsquo;m going to be making yet, but I have plenty of interests that should help guide my learning. I&rsquo;m mostly interested in finding out what I can reasonably achieve as a one-person team in a year or two. Some of these interests include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-player, story driven games</li>
<li>Procedural generation</li>
<li>Sound and music design</li>
<li>Visual effects, particle systems</li>
<li>Lighting (particularly - dynamic lighting)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whats-up-first">What&rsquo;s up first?<a href="#whats-up-first" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>In Unity, it took me around a week to get a well running procedural terrain generator off the ground. I expect with Unreal (and very rusty C++ knowledge) this could be longer. I&rsquo;ve started looking already, and the resources available are very slim. Most reading around proc-gen in Unreal is focused on Blueprints and existing plugins, which don&rsquo;t seem particularly flexible to the experimentation I&rsquo;d like to do.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be working on some prototypes in both engines to see what I enjoy more, and go from there.</p>
